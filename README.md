## Description

_Better doctor has offered their help to Epicodus in allowing our (Epicodus's) students to practice using api calls to their database of doctors. A user should be able to get a list of doctors: practice locations, phone numbers, doctor's name, and whether or not they are still accepting new patients._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _In the top level of the file, run: $touch .env_
* _open that file, and add 'exports.apiKey = [your API key here]'_
* _If you have node installed on your device, $npm install_
* _run $npm start_

_Your site should automatically open in browser_
